                        <p>Based from the data from the National Voluntary Blood Services Program, a total of 654,763 blood units were collected in 2009. Fifty-eight percent of which was from voluntary blood donation and the remaining from replacement donation. This year, particular provinces have already achieved 100% voluntary blood donation. The DOH is hoping that many individuals will become regular voluntary unpaid donors to guarantee sufficient supply of safe blood and to meet national blood necessities.</p>
